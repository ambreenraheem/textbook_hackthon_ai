# Appendix G: Industry Standards and Safety Guidelines

Comprehensive overview of industry standards, safety regulations, and compliance requirements for robotics.

## International Standards Organizations

### ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

**ISO 10218**: Robots and robotic devices - Safety requirements for industrial robots
- Part 1: Robots
- Part 2: Robot systems and integration

**ISO/TS 15066**: Collaborative robots - Safety requirements
- Defines power and force limits for human-robot collaboration
- Specifies risk assessment procedures

**ISO 13482**: Safety requirements for personal care robots
- Covers service robots in non-industrial environments
- Mobile servant robots, physical assistant robots, person carrier robots

### ANSI/RIA (American National Standards Institute / Robotics Industries Association)

**ANSI/RIA R15.06**: Industrial Robots and Robot Systems - Safety Requirements
- U.S. adoption of ISO 10218 with additions

**ANSI/RIA R15.08**: Industrial Mobile Robots - Safety Requirements
- Safety for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)

## Safety Guidelines

### Risk Assessment

1. **Hazard Identification**: Mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiation, material/substance
2. **Risk Estimation**: Severity and probability
3. **Risk Evaluation**: Acceptable vs. unacceptable
4. **Risk Reduction**: Eliminate, substitute, guard, inform

### Collaborative Robot Safety

**Speed and Separation Monitoring**
- Minimum protective distance calculation
- Speed reduction based on human proximity

**Hand Guiding**
- Operator control during guided motion
- Enabling device requirements

**Power and Force Limiting**
- Maximum permissible forces and pressures
- Transient and quasi-static contact

## Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)

- **EN 61000**: EMC immunity and emissions standards
- **FCC Part 15**: Radio frequency devices (U.S.)

## Functional Safety

- **IEC 61508**: Functional safety of electrical/electronic systems
- **ISO 13849**: Safety-related parts of control systems

## Communication Standards
