# Chapter 3: Mathematical Fundamentals for Robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Apply linear algebra concepts to robot kinematics
- Understand transformation matrices and coordinate frames
- Solve forward and inverse kinematics problems
- Use differential equations for motion modeling

## Introduction

Mathematical fundamentals form the backbone of robotics. Understanding linear algebra, transformation matrices, and kinematics is essential for controlling and programming humanoid robots.

## Transformation Matrices

Transformation matrices are used to represent the position and orientation of objects in 3D space. They enable us to convert coordinates between different reference frames.

### Interactive Transformation Matrix Visualizer

Explore how rotation and scaling transformations affect a 2D object:

import InteractiveDiagram from '@site/src/components/InteractiveDiagram';

  defaultScale={1.2}

### Key Concepts

**Rotation Matrix (2D):**
```
R(θ) = [cos(θ)  -sin(θ)]
       [sin(θ)   cos(θ)]
```

**Scaling Matrix (2D):**
```
S(s) = [s  0]
       [0  s]
```

**Combined Transformation:**
The combined transformation matrix applies both rotation and scaling:
```
T = S(s) × R(θ)
```

## Linear Algebra for Robotics

### Vectors and Coordinate Frames

In robotics, we frequently work with multiple coordinate frames:
- **World frame**: Fixed reference frame
- **Robot base frame**: Attached to the robot's base
- **End-effector frame**: Attached to the robot's hand or tool

### Matrix Operations

Understanding matrix multiplication, inverse, and transpose operations is crucial for:
- Forward kinematics (joint angles → end-effector position)
- Inverse kinematics (desired position → joint angles)
- Velocity and force transformations

## Kinematics

### Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles:

```
x = f(θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ)
```

### Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics solves for joint angles needed to reach a desired end-effector pose. This is typically more complex and may have multiple solutions or no solution.

## Differential Equations

Differential equations describe how systems change over time, essential for:
- Motion planning
- Trajectory generation
- Dynamic simulation
- Control system design

### Example: Simple Harmonic Motion

The equation of motion for a spring-mass system:
```
m(d²x/dt²) + kx = 0
```

This type of differential equation appears frequently in robot dynamics and control.

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate the 2D transformation matrix for a 90° rotation followed by scaling by factor 2
2. Find the inverse of a given transformation matrix
3. Derive the forward kinematics for a 2-link planar arm
4. Solve a simple differential equation for robot motion
